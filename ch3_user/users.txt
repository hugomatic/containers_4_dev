Groups and users

Creating a group in a Unix-like system and giving its users access to specific
resources involves a few steps. Here's a detailed guide on how to do this:

1. Create a New Group

To create a new group, use the groupadd command. For example, to create a
group named mygroup:

  sudo groupadd mygroup

2. Add Users to the Group

To add users to this group, use the usermod command. For example, to add a user
named username to mygroup:

  sudo usermod -aG mygroup username

-aG option adds the user to the supplementary group (mygroup in this case).
Make sure to replace username with the actual username.

3. Set Group Ownership on Resources

To give the group access to certain files or directories, change the group
ownership of these resources to your new group. For example, to change the group
ownership of a directory /path/to/directory to mygroup:

    sudo chown :mygroup /path/to/directory

This command keeps the current owner but changes the group to mygroup.

4. Set Permissions

Set appropriate permissions on the resources so that the group members can
access them. Unix permissions are read (r), write (w), and execute (x).
Use the chmod command to set these permissions.

For example, to give group members read and write access to /path/to/directory:


  sudo chmod 770 /path/to/directory

Here, 770 means full permissions for the owner and the group, and no permissions
for others.

5. Apply Changes

For changes to group membership to take effect, users usually need to log out
and log back in. In some cases, a system reboot might be required.

Example: Creating a Shared Folder

Let's say you want to create a shared folder that all members of mygroup can
access and modify:

Create the group:

    sudo groupadd mygroup

Add users to the group:


    sudo usermod -aG mygroup user1
    sudo usermod -aG mygroup user2

Repeat for all users you want to add

Create the shared directory and set its group ownership:


    sudo mkdir /path/to/sharedfolder
    sudo chown :mygroup /path/to/sharedfolder

Set permissions so all group members can read, write, and execute:

    sudo chmod 2770 /path/to/sharedfolder
